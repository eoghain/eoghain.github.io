title: Mobile First - what it really means
---

You hear the term **Mobile First** thrown around a lot lately when it comes to building a new application.  Unfortunately I don't think everyone is on the same page when it comes to what **Mobile First** means.  I hope to enlighten you as to it's meaning in this post and hopefully you'll walk away with a greater understanding of the issues facing you when building an application for our increasingly mobile world.

First off I don't believe that **Mobile First** means building out your application for a mobile platform before any other.  Which is how I expect most people take the meaning of that term.  You don't have to release a mobile product before your web or desktop product.  What you do have to do is consider the mobile platform and it's limitations when building an application.  Understanding that someone may be viewing your content on a 3.5" screen (iPhone 4S screen size) will inform your decisions when it comes to data density, or workflow, or API structure.
