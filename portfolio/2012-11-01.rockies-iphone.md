Lead a skunkworks project with another developer to built a mobile application to allow students to go to the University of the Rockies online school on their mobile phone.  Successfully pitched the idea with a rough beta version of the application to the CEO after 3 months of night and weekend work.  Successfully launched the first version of the Rockies Mobile Classroom 3 months after that to rave reviews by our students and a flood of requests for expanded features.  Continued to lead this team building multiple versions of the Mobile Classroom and other mobile applications for 3 years.
