Working with 1 other developer built an eBook reader.  Built in ability to have quizes embedded in eBooks so users could test their comprehension of the material they were reading.  Built in full text search capabilities to the HTML content of the books.  Created download management tools to allow multiple books to be downloaded in the background without interfering with the user.
