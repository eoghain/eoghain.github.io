Rewrote the form layout engine from scratch using Auto Layout.  Previous to this re-write the iOS app for Turbo Tax was unable to display images, bullet points, or nested tabular layouts for many of it's data entry screens.

Built the native Drivers License Scanning functionality to take away the hassel and worry of typing in personal information.

Integrated the [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios) library to remove the need for hand coded animations and put the animation creation firmly in the hands of professional animators.
