A from scratch re-write in Swift to bring the code up to current best practices.  Integrated the tax calculation engine and modified it to calculate for multiple tax years.  Helped design and implement a display agnostic file format for displaying the pages and questions along with hiding/showing questions based on previous answers, this format is used by both the iOS an Android versions of the app.
