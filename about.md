This is my personal blog where I'll be posting my thoughts, ideas, code and anything else that I feel fits in with my concept of **3 Screens** and **Mobile First** Development. 

Ever since I first started developing for a mobile platform in 2009, I've been obsessed with the right way to build mobile applications.  This medium is at once both old and new, and incredibly challenging and fun to work with.  It is old, because device limitations bring us back to the heyday of the personal computer where you had limited memory, storage, and processing power to work with in delivering your applications.  It is new because we are dealing with an entirely new concept of mobile, take it anywhere, computing that's never been done before, with the added constraints of battery life, bandwidth and data limits.  I believe we have only just scratched the surface of what mobile applications can and will be (like viewing Windows 3.1 for the first time) and I will be there as it evolves, hopefully contributing to that evolution.  I enjoy the challenges involved in working in this medium and do my best to push forward the **"Mobile First"** strategies that will help companies succeed in this new world of mobile devices.  Thinking **"Mobile First"** isn't about designing mobile applications, it's about designing systems that can live and thrive on mobile devices, because anything that can be done on one of those devices can be done on any system and starting your architecture thinking about your least capable client is what will make your applications sing on your most capable clients.
