An `UICollectionViewLayout` that uses supplemental views to display a folder below a cell that looks like the screen was split. Mimics the pre iOS7 springboard groups visualization. Wrote this because all of the other "folder" controls like this use a screen shot to do the splitting, but I wanted my collection view to still be functional even with the folder open.
