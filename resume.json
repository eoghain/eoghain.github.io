I've never met a challenge that I couldn't meet and typically meet ahead of schedule.  \n\nFor the last 6 years I've been working exclusively in the mobile space and am intrigued by the ability to have ubiquitous computing with us wherever we go.  Designing applications that allow users to interact with them weather they are on a PC, tablet, phone, or even TV is a challenge I find very rewarding.",
