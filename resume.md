## Summary

I've been working as a software engineer for over 15 years.  I've been involved in every aspect of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) from planning to deployment.  I've never met a challenge that I couldn't meet and typically meet ahead of schedule.  

For the last 6 years I've been working exclusively in the mobile space and am intrigued by the ability to have ubiquitous computing with us wherever we go.  Designing applications that allow users to interact with them weather they are on a PC, tablet, phone, or even TV is a challenge I find very rewarding.

### Programmer, Financial Database Services
##### 1998-07-01 - 1999-08-01


With only an outline and instructions about what technologies I could and couldn’t use I built a system to maintain a source code tree.  This system connected to SCCS to manage the archiving and versioning of the files, but gave the programmers an easy to use interface for checking out code and working on it.  The system maintained a queue of file requests, removing the tedious task of a programmer having to keep checking to see if a file they needed was available.  This code streamlined the programmer’s workday and speeded up production.

> Rob is an excellent developer to work with. He’s passionate about the design of the products he works on and we would often collaborate on design decisions. Rob is one of those developers who will fight for the right solution to a product even if its not the popular idea. Once he’s got a problem to solve he will often run with it and try to find the best and most innovative way to solve the problem. He is a great person to work with and I will miss collaborating with him on projects. -- Noelle Stransky
